# Learning-GitHub

This is a repo documenting my code learning journey and GitHub exploits.

Aspriations include:

- Learning what GitHub is / does and how to use it
- Learning Python
- Developing viable and functional systems and tools
- Developing my own InfoSec supporting tools, starting with an interactive GRC tool

Any reviewers of this repository are welcome to provide any and all direction and guidance where possible. I am eager to learn. I will make (a lot of) mistakes, and I will be happy for those in the community to point them out to me so I can find better and efficient ways of doing things.

Thank you.
